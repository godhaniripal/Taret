# play
###  play( from:Number, suppressEvents:Boolean ) : self
Begins playing forward, optionally from a specific time (by default playback begins from wherever the playhead currently is).
#### Parameters
  * ####  **from** : Number
(default = `null`) - The time from which the animation should begin playing (if none is defined, it will begin playing from wherever the playhead currently is).
  * ####  **suppressEvents** : Boolean
(default = `true`) - If `true` (the default), no events or callbacks will be triggered when the playhead moves to the new position defined in the `from` parameter.


### Returns : self[​](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/GSAP/Tween/play\(\)/#returns--self "Direct link to Returns : self")
self (makes chaining easier)
### Details[​](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/GSAP/Tween/play\(\)/#details "Direct link to Details")
Begins playing forward, optionally from a specific time (by default playback begins from wherever the playhead currently is). This also ensures that the instance is neither paused nor reversed.
If you define a "from" time (the first parameter, which could also be a label for timeline instances), the playhead moves there immediately and if there are any events/callbacks inbetween where the playhead was and the new time, they will not be triggered because by default `suppressEvents` (the 2nd parameter) is `true`. Think of it like picking the needle up on a record player and moving it to a new position before placing it back on the record. If, however, you do not want the events/callbacks suppressed during that initial move, simply set the `suppressEvents` parameter to `false`.
```
//begins playing from wherever the playhead currently is:  
myAnimation.play();  
  
//begins playing from exactly 2-seconds into the animation:  
myAnimation.play(2);  
  
// jumps to exactly 2-seconds into the animation and starts playing but doesn't suppress events (meaning it will trigger any callbacks between the old and new playhead positions):  
myAnimation.play(2,false);  

```

if the Tween's timeScale is exactly 0 when play() is called, it will be changed to 1 (otherwise it wouldn't play). If you're going to tween it up from 0 you can set it to a very small number before calling play() like `myAnimation.timeScale(myAnimation.timeScale() || 0.001).play()` so that it doesn't jump to 1.
