# RoughEase
Quick Start
#### CDN Link
Copy
```
gsap.registerPlugin(EasePack)  

```

#### Minimal usage
```
// we're starting at a scale of 1 and animating to 2, so pass those into config()...  
gsap.to("#image",{duration:1,scale:2,ease:"expoScale(1, 2)"});  

```

This ease is in the EasePack file. To learn how to include this in your project, see [the Installation page](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Installation).
### Description[​](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Eases/RoughEase/#description "Direct link to Description")
Most easing equations give a smooth, gradual transition between the start and end values, but `RoughEase` provides an easy way to get a rough, jagged effect instead, or you can also get an evenly-spaced back-and-forth movement if you prefer. `RoughEase` is in the EasePack file. Configure the `RoughEase` with any of these optional properties:
### Config Object[​](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Eases/RoughEase/#config-object "Direct link to Config Object")
### Property
### Description
  * #### clamp[](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Eases/RoughEase/#clamp)
Boolean - Setting `clamp` to `true` will prevent points from exceeding the end value or dropping below the starting value. For example, if you’re tweening the x property from 0 to 100, the RoughEase would force all random points to stay between 0 and 100 if `clamp` is `true`, but if it is `false`, x could potentially jump above 100 or below 0 at some point during the tween (it would always end at 100 though in this example). Default: `false`.
  * #### points[](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Eases/RoughEase/#points)
Number - The number of points to be plotted along the ease, making it jerk more or less frequently. Default: `20`.
  * #### randomize[](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Eases/RoughEase/#randomize)
Boolean - By default, the placement of points will be randomized (creating the roughness) but you can set `randomize` to `false` to make the points zig-zag evenly across the ease. Using this in conjunction with a `taper` value can create a nice effect. Default: `true`.
  * #### strength[](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Eases/RoughEase/#strength)
Number - Controls how far from the template ease the points are allowed to wander (a small number like 0.1 keeps it very close to the template ease whereas a larger number like 5 creates much bigger variations). Default: `1`.
  * #### taper[](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Eases/RoughEase/#taper)
String (`"in"` | `"out"` | `"both"` | `"none"`) - To make the strength of the roughness taper towards the end or beginning or both, use `"out"`, `"in"`, or `"both"` respectively. Default: `"none"`.
  * #### template[](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Eases/RoughEase/#template)
String - An ease that should be used as a template, like a general guide. The RoughEase will plot points that wander from that template. You can use this to influence the general shape of the RoughEase. Default: `"none"`.


### Example code[​](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Eases/RoughEase/#example-code "Direct link to Example code")
```
//use the default values  
gsap.from(element,{duration:1,opacity:0,ease:"rough"});  
  
//or customize the configuration  
gsap.to(element,{duration:2,y:300,ease:"rough({strength: 3, points: 50, template: strong.inOut, taper: both, randomize: false})"});  

```
