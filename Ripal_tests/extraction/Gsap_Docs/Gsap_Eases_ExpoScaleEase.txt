# ExpoScaleEase
Quick Start
#### CDN Link
Copy
```
gsap.registerPlugin(EasePack)  

```

#### Minimal usage
```
// we're starting at a scale of 1 and animating to 2, so pass those into config()...  
gsap.to("#image",{duration:1,scale:2,ease:"expoScale(1, 2)"});  

```

This ease is in the EasePack file. To learn how to include this in your project, see [the Installation page](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Installation).
### Description[​](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Eases/ExpoScaleEase/#description "Direct link to Description")
There's an interesting phenomena that occurs when you animate an object's `scale` that makes it appear to change speed **even with a linear ease** ; `ExpoScaleEase` compensates for this effect by bending the easing curve accordingly. This is the secret sauce for silky-smooth zooming/scaling animations.
### Video Explanation[​](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Eases/ExpoScaleEase/#video-explanation "Direct link to Video Explanation")
### Configuration[​](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Eases/ExpoScaleEase/#configuration "Direct link to Configuration")
In order for ExpoScaleEase to create the correct easing curve, you must pass in the **starting** and **ending** scale values in the string, like:
```
// we're starting at a scale of 1 and animating to 2, so pass those into config()...  
gsap.to("#image",{duration:1,scale:2,ease:"expoScale(1, 2)"});  

```

It can also accept a 3rd parameter, the ease that you'd like it to bend (the default is `"none"`). So, for example, if you'd like to use `"power2.inOut"`, your code would look like:
```
//scale from 0.5 to 3 using "power2.inOut" ...  
gsap.fromTo(  
"#image",  
{scale:0.5},  
{duration:1,scale:3,ease:"expoScale(0.5, 3, power2.inOut)"}  
);  

```

**Note:** The scale values passed into the `config()` method **must be non-zero** because the math wouldn't work with 0. You're welcome to use a small value like 0.01 instead. Using a _SUPER_ small number like 0.00000001 may not be ideal because a large portion of the tween would be used going through the very small values.
